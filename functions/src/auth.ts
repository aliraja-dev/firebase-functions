**A user signs in to a new anonymous auth session for the first time.
**A Cloud Functions event is not triggered when a user signs in for the first time using a custom token.

//!Caution: Deleting multiple users at once using the Firebase Admin SDK (for example, admin.auth().deleteUsers([uid1, uid2]) in Node.js) does not fire user deletion events, so event handlers set up using functions.auth.user().onDelete() will not be triggered. Delete users one at a time if you want user deletion events to fire for each deleted user.
